# Open Source Code of Conduct

In order to foster an inclusive, kind, harassment-free, and cooperative community, we enforce this code of conduct on our open source projects.

## Summary

Harassment in code and discussion or violation of physical boundaries is completely
unacceptable anywhere in the project codebases, issue trackers, chatrooms, mailing
lists, meetups, and other events. Violators will be warned by the core team members.
Repeat violations will result in being blocked or banned by the core team at or before
the 3rd violation.

## In detail

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender identity, gender expression,
sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual
images, deliberate intimidation, stalking, sustained disruption, and unwelcome sexual
attention.

Individuals asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Maintainers are also subject to the anti-harassment policy.

If anyone engages in harassing behavior, including maintainers, we may take appropriate
action, up to and including warning the offender, deletion of comments, removal from
the project codebase and communication systems, and escalation to the support teams.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any
other concerns, please contact a member of the core team or email us immediately.

We expect everyone to follow these rules anywhere in the project codebases, issue trackers,
chatrooms, mailing lists, etc.

Finally, don't forget that it is human to make mistakes! We all do. Let's work together
to help each other, resolve issues, and learn from the mistakes that we will all inevitably
make from time to time.

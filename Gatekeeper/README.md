# Arduino GateKeeper project.

Servos are turned against each other, so they have a slightly different turn angles. Also
both servos are detached after they are used to avoid any unnecessary energy consumption.

Servos are wired to Arduino GND (black), 5V (red) and pins 7 (servo 1 yellow)
and 9 (servo 2 yellow). This can be configured in gate1pin and gate2pin respectively.

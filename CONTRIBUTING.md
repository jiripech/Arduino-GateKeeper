# Contributing

We love pull requests from everyone. By participating in this project,
you agree to abide by the [conduct of code](CONDUCT_OF_CODE.md).

## Fork, then clone the repo:

    git clone git@github.com:jiripech/Arduino-GateKeeper.git

## Push to your fork and submit a pull request

If you are not sure what we mean by that,
please read [this article](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/ title="Using pull requests")
first.

At this point you're waiting on us. We like to at least comment on pull requests
within three business days (and, typically, one business day). We may suggest
some changes or improvements or alternatives.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

* Write tests and preferably test your design at work.
* Write a good commit message.
